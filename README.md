# Introduction to LaTeX

A brief intro to LaTeX and friends. Probably biased.
Certainly incomplete.
But what do you want?
It's a huge ecosystem and it's awesomely disorganized
at times!
Still, if you're willing to learn, you'll be rewarded
with almost limitless typographic beauty.

## Contents

- **01-minimal-document.tex** is just about the
  shortest thing that will compile

- **02-basic-article.tex** shows something more
  complete; minimal knowledge for a rough term
  paper I would guess

- **03-fancier-article.tex** uses some packages
  to make things look nicer, shows off a basic
  bibliography; what you'd really want for a
  moderately decent term paper

- **04-lecture-notes.tex** and **04-lecture-notes.bib**
  shows off a more complex document (lecture notes for
  a fictitious course) and messes with lots of things
  including chapter headings; shows how an index and an
  external bibliography can be used; TODO add examples
  of cross-referencing

- **05-color-test.tex** and **jhcolors.sty**
  demonstrates how to hack a custom style file

- **26-epigrams.tex** is just another example
  for laying out a document, a famous one in
  this case

- **50-tikz-rs-latch.tex** has a *very* simple
  TikZ example for drawing a basic circuit

- **99-basic-presentation.tex** shows how to put
  together a simple presentation using beamer

## History

I wrote most of this stuff for a talk I gave to the
Johns Hopkins ACM chapter on 2015/02/12.
I didn't get through all the material, never touched
writing your own .sty files for example.
Let's see if I reprise the talk more frequently now,
the last time I recall giving a similar talk was in
2007 or so. Yikes!
