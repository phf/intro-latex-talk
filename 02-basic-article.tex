Oh the wonders of \LaTeX!
As you can see a lot of the layout is completely
automatic and moderately boring.

\section{Introduction}

Where you introduce the topic you want to rant
about for the next few pages.

\section{Methodology}

Where you describe the approach you took and
attempt to justify why it's valid.

\section{Results}

Where you give the results of your experiments
and explain away any anomalies that might be
embarrassing.

\section{Related Work}

Where you describe work that others have done
and either praise it or rip it to shreds.

\section{Conclusions}

Where you tell people that don't read the rest
what it all means; presumably also where you
state that more research is definitely needed.

\appendix

\section{Appendix}

Where you say whatever you couldn't say earlier
in the paper for some reason.
